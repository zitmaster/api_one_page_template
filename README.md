# api_one_page_template

This is a one-page template to make a neat web-app using an external API with jQuery. The app use the following frameworks and boilerplates:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis">Some public API with little or no authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars javascript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize css</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
</ul>

To get started, download the project and open index.html in your browser as well as in a code editor. Study the structure to get an overall picture of how handlebars, jQuery and Materialize work together to show the results from the API queries. 

Use the template to create your own app with an API of your liking or needs.
